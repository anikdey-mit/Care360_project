INTRODUCTION

--------------------------------------

Care360 is a website developed for children aged 8-12 to help them learn about potential risks associated to their grandparent's health and house. Grandchildren, along with their grandparents, will assess the questionnaires and with the recommendations from the website, they will try to make little changes to their grandparents lifestyle which may prevent big injuries.
